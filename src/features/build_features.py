# --------------------------------------------------------------

# Droping all of the missing values that are currently present in the data frame 
df_freq = df_freq.dropna()

# On loking in literature you'll see that typically an allowance of 50% is recommended meaning that in our case we will get rid of 50% of the data by skipping every other row and this will result in alot of data loss but it has been shown to pay off in the long run by making your models less prone to overfitting 
df_freq = df_freq.iloc[::2]   # This way of writing iloc specifies that you want every other row or every 2nd row (starting from the 1st initial row of the data frame)

# Just like PCA we can use the elbow method here again but now using different values namely the inertia which is the sum of squared distances of samples to the closest cluster center and we 'll be computing that for each K so for each number of clusters and we'll basically loop over various numbers of K and then create a plot for determinig the optimal amount of K for our dataset

# We can now have a look at the individual exercises and see where they eblong withing this 3-dimensional plot, so we can see that the bench press and the overhead press vary close to each other which is to be expected bcoz the movements look alot like each other and also in  green and gray we've deadlift and the row which also look very similar to each other, we can see that squat is very different from all the other exercises & rest is all over the place which is also to be expected bcoz rest is pretty random
