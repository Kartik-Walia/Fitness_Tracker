# Fitness Tracker

This collaborative project was conducted by [Kartik Walia](https://github.com/Kartik-Walia) (Branch: CSE) and [Ishita Sharma](https://github.com/ishitasharma32) (Branch: MAC).

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of sensor data to track and evaluate physical exercises. The data includes accelerometer and gyroscope readings, aiming to predict and classify different exercise patterns.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kartik-Walia/Fitness_Tracker.git
    cd Fitness_Tracker
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Fitness_Tracker
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

The project is structured into two main parts: data preprocessing and machine learning. The data preprocessing pipeline includes outlier detection, feature engineering, and data transformation. The machine learning phase involves training and evaluating various models.

### Data Preprocessing

- **Outlier Detection**: Detecting outliers using the LOF (Local Outlier Factor) approach.
- **Feature Engineering**: Applying techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis), Butterworth filter, and temporal abstraction.
- **Data Transformation**: Handling missing values, interpolating, and applying rolling averages.

### Machine Learning

- **Train-Test Split**: Stratified train-test split based on labeled data.
- **Feature Selection**: Implementing forward feature selection using a decision tree.
- **Model Selection**: Utilizing a range of classifiers, including neural networks, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and naive Bayes.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search for optimal hyperparameters.

## Dataset

The dataset includes sensor readings (accelerometer and gyroscope) during various physical exercises. Data is categorized by participants, sets, and exercise labels.

## Model Selection

Among Neural Network (NN), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), and Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest was selected as the learning algorithm due to its superior accuracy for the given features.
